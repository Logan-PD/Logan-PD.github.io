            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>In this project we were challenged with coming up with a new way and creative way to unlock a mobile phone.
                    Our team came up with a touch based solution, the guitar unlock, and a sensory based solution, the falling bird unlock.
                </p>
                <h3 class="colour">Multi-touch Guitar unlock</h3>
                <p>For our innovative multi-touch unlocking system, we embarked on a journey of ideation, exploring a multitude of intriguing concepts. Among these, "Cosmic Alignment" emerged, envisioning users interacting with celestial entities akin to planets for phone access. Another concept, "Composition Unlock," entailed crafting a unique musical composition that, when performed correctly, would grant device entry. Lastly, the "Zodiac Unlock" required users to input a constellation sign corresponding to their chosen symbol for unlocking.
                    <br><br>
                    After extensive deliberation and the creation of initial sketches for each idea, it became apparent that the Composition Unlock not only stood as a unique approach but also promised an engaging user experience. As we transitioned from concept to implementation, our focus shifted towards refining the user interface, departing from the conventional guitar-like design to elevate the overall interaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon a sagacious suggestion from our professor, we integrated a musical element, enriching user interaction with harmonious notes upon key activation. While Heer led the charge in design and conceptualization, Kai took the helm in crafting the user interface and ensuring seamless functionality on both the front-end and back-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Simultaneously, Logan integrated the musical effects into the website, guaranteeing flawless operation of the entire system.

                <h3 class="colour">Sensory-based bird fall</h3>
                <p>Logan pioneered the sensory-based unlocking method, introducing innovative concepts such as the shake pattern, where users move the phone in a specific pattern to interact with the screen and unlock the device. Another inventive idea involved using vocal cues, where users could hum a tune, and the device would unlock once the correct melody was sung. As the implementation evolved, remarkable concepts emerged, including the angle unlock, which required physically manipulating the phone to reach a specific angle for unlocking. Another concept was the ladder, where a ball navigated between rungs, ultimately landing on the correct one to unlock the device. Ted endorsed this implementation, recognizing its potential.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the iterations, notable improvements were made, notably refining the locking mechanism to incorporate a tile-based approach rather than simply reaching the end, enhancing overall security. Additionally, meticulous attention was paid to the user interface. Ted authored the Unity script for the unlock screen, augmenting it with various illustrations to enhance the website's visual appeal.

                                    Logan's guitar composition employing a multi-touch method allows users to select keys and strum them to produce sound. This method holds great appeal, as it not only offers an enjoyable experience but also provides room for enhancements, including adding sound to the corresponding chords.

                                    This approach employs sensory techniques such as singing and humming to unlock the device. In the depicted scenario, Kai illustrates users attempting to reproduce a specific tune set as their password. If the gathered rendition is incorrect, users receive a notification about its inaccuracy. Additionally, users have the option to specify how much of the tune they wish to record.

                                    Some of the more detailed illustrations demonstrate the capability to record notes. They go even further by displaying voice frequency alongside visual representations of the musical notes. In contrast, certain depictions showcase a fixed set of notes, requiring them to be sung to access specific ones. Another option explored involved using a keyboard or a musical instrument to indicate the notes. Despite the extensive scope of possibilities, this approach was ultimately not chosen. We were particularly focused on developing the guitar unlocking method for the multi-touch system, and it may have been too complex to pursue given our limited experience with sensory applications.

                                    Ted developed a sensory-based phone unlocking method that relies on specific motion patterns. By moving the phone diagonally or up and down, it can be unlocked. While this approach appeared enjoyable, it didn't garner much interest for further exploration, as it seemed rather straightforward and lacked uniqueness.

                                    Ted developed a motion-based sensory unlocking method. In this approach, users must set the angle on their device to one that closely matches the intended unlocking angle. Once this angle is reached, the phone unlocks. While this method appears effective, it also brings to mind a similar technique used in a prior project by another group, where they employed a rotating lock for phone access.

                                    The innovative sensory motion technique devised by Ted involves gently tilting the phone from side to side, facilitating the movement of the ball from one rung to another. Eventually, it aligns perfectly with the correct rung, enabling the phone to be unlocked and accessed. This approach not only demonstrated uniqueness but also added an element of enjoyment to the process. Ultimately, our team decided that this implementation was the most effective choice.

                                    This implementation, conceived by Ted, involves a sensory response to the motion of water descending when the phone is tilted. The act of water cascading down serves as the mechanism for unlocking the phone. While this approach initially appears intriguing, it also raises concerns. It seems straightforward and potentially lacks the robust security needed for unlocking sensitive devices.

                                    Ted also devised this sensory approach to unlock the phone. In this method, if the device is held at a specific angle for a designated duration in a particular pattern, the phone would unlock. While this unlocking mechanism proved effective, it appeared somewhat simplistic and lacked the distinctive and enjoyable elements present in some of our other methods.

                <p>The development process for the engaging clicker button game involved evaluating and selecting the top 10 ideas out of 40. 
                        The "Monkey Poop War" concept, though unique, was considered too complex. The "Clicker Game" stood out for its simplicity and creative potential. 
                        Other ideas included bird-viewing, color combinations, and expression-changing applications.
                        <br><br>
                        The top contenders were "Monkey Poop War," "Clicker Game," "Bird Sounds," "Color Changing Game," and "Expression Changing." 
                        Sketches for the color mixing game showed creativity but faced limitations. 
                        The monkey poop game offered complexity but was ultimately set aside due to logistical challenges. 
                        The bird-viewing application needed further depth.
                        <br><br>
                        The process highlighted the need for an idea balancing uniqueness and feasibility. 
                        The clicker game emerged as a promising choice, with Thet's implementation adding innovative elements like a metronome and various game modes to improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes.
                        <br><br>
                        The resulting clicker game is designed to enhance hand-eye coordination and reflex responses in a fun and interactive manner. It offers diverse modes including 'Normal Mode' for classic clicking, 
                        'Color Mode' for visual stimulation, and 'Animal Mode' for both entertainment and education. With these options, players can tailor their experience, ensuring hours of entertainment and skill-building.

                <p>We created a tier list of our top 40 ideas so that it is easy to rate them, our tier list ranged from (S) to (D), where (S) represents the top of the tier list and (D) represents the bottom-most tier. 
                    This made the sorting easier, making us consider only the top 10 ideas. Following are those top 10 ideas.
