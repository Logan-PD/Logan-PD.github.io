            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>The Board is a project aimed at enhancing communication for social settings. The basic premise is that each user has a live personal board. On their board they are able to customize widgets, themes, and who has access to it.
                    Anyone with access to their friends board can then write on it at any time, and the live drawing will appear for everyone who has access to it. This allows user's to write messages on their own boards as
                    broadcast messages, for example, "Going to study at the library at 11am today. Anyone is welcome to join!", or friends can write on a users board to talk directly to their friends, as is shown in the demo video below.<br>
                    Although this project is just a prototype, the complete version would have large projections on the wall where users can draw directly with their hands, or access it through their computer or phone.

                <p>Developing the idea for The Board came from the prompt to "Enhance Communication". We then used the 10+10 sketching method to generate the following sketches before deciding to implement The Board.</p>

            <h2 class="title proj colour">Arduino Posture Corrector ↓</h2>
            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>For this project, we were prompted to “solve an everyday problem” using the basic Arduino kit hardware. After numerous ideas and sketches, our group decided on the posture corrector. The problem our device solves is bad posture over time when working at a desk. 
                    By mounting an ultrasonic sensor to the headrest of a chair, the Arduino software will constantly scan for a distance threshold. When the user has a bad posture, their head and back will be slouched forward, exceeding the 
                    distance threshold and triggering the buzzer and alarm, causing the user to maintain good posture. Our final prototype used cardboard to cover the wire and circuitry and make the device look like a usable appliance. 
                </p>

                <p>Below is our concept video showcaseing the final prototype.</p>

                <h3 class="colour">Sketching and Ideation Phase</h3>
                <p>Before deciding on our idea of the posture corrector, collectively and individually we went through the concept sketches and detailed sketches phases of design</p>

                                    The automatic fan was created by Logan as a way to automatically trigger a fan based on a temperature and humidity sensor.

We decided not to pursue this idea due to its simplicity.

                                    The closet organiser is an idea by Logan that helps to keep a cluttered closet organised.

While this idea was interesting, due to hardware constraints, we decided not to pursue it.

                                    The pet feeder is an idea created by Logan that solves the problem of forgetting to feed your pet. Using an internal timer in the arduino software, at a set interval, for example 6am and 6pm, a motor would activate and let the food bowl be filled from a reservoir. In the end we decided not to pursue this idea due to similar products already existing.

                                    The pet toy was drawn by Logan and serves as a way for cats, dogs and other small pets to entertain themselves. The basic idea is that the toy will be able to move itself away from the pet using an ultrasonic sensor and motors. Furthermore, the toy would have some sort of decoration on it that pets would want to play with. We decided not to further explore this idea because similar products already exist.

            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>In this project we were challenged with coming up with a new way and creative way to unlock a mobile phone.
                    Our team came up with a touch based solution, the guitar unlock, and a sensory based solution, the falling bird unlock.
                </p>
                <h3 class="colour">Multi-touch Guitar unlock</h3>
                <p>For our innovative multi-touch unlocking system, we embarked on a journey of ideation, exploring a multitude of intriguing concepts. Among these, "Cosmic Alignment" emerged, envisioning users interacting with celestial entities akin to planets for phone access. Another concept, "Composition Unlock," 
                    entailed crafting a unique musical composition that, when performed correctly, would grant device entry. Lastly, the "Zodiac Unlock" required users to input a constellation sign corresponding to their chosen symbol for unlocking.
                    <br><br>
                    After extensive deliberation and the creation of initial sketches for each idea, it became apparent that the Composition Unlock not only stood as a unique approach but also promised an engaging user experience. As we transitioned from concept to implementation, our focus shifted towards refining the user interface, departing from the conventional guitar-like design to elevate the overall interaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon a sagacious suggestion from our professor, we integrated a musical element, enriching user interaction with harmonious notes upon key activation. While Heer led the charge in design and conceptualization, Kai took the helm in crafting the user interface and ensuring seamless functionality on both the front-end and back-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Simultaneously, Logan integrated the musical effects into the website, guaranteeing flawless operation of the entire system.

                <h3 class="colour">Sensory-based bird fall</h3>
                <p>Logan pioneered the sensory-based unlocking method, introducing innovative concepts such as the shake pattern, where users move the phone in a specific pattern to interact with the screen and unlock the device. Another inventive idea involved using vocal cues, 
                    where users could hum a tune, and the device would unlock once the correct melody was sung. As the implementation evolved, remarkable concepts emerged, including the angle unlock, which required physically manipulating the phone to reach a specific angle for unlocking. Another concept was the ladder, where a ball navigated between rungs, ultimately landing on the correct one to unlock the device. Ted endorsed this implementation, recognizing its potential.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the iterations, notable improvements were made, notably refining the locking mechanism to incorporate a tile-based approach rather than simply reaching the end, enhancing overall security. Additionally, meticulous attention was paid to the user interface. Ted authored the Unity script for the unlock screen, augmenting it with various illustrations to enhance the website's visual appeal.

While this design for multi-touch demonstrates a clever concept, it garnered only two out of four votes in favor during the proposal phase. The majority of members expressed reservations about its viability as a final choice, citing potential difficulty for users to consistently reproduce the exact color and a belief that other ideas might offer greater creativity.

                                        For this multi-touch unlocking system, users would need to align all the planets in the correct sequence for the phone to unlock. This concept initially appeared quite innovative, promising an engaging user experience. However, it faced a couple of significant drawbacks. Firstly, representing the entire solar system on a mobile screen posed a challenge. If only a few parts of the system were visible at a time, it would diminish the overall user experience. Additionally, creating a visually appealing and enjoyable interface presented another difficulty. In the proposal stage, only three out of the four members supported this idea.

                <p>The development process for the engaging clicker button game involved evaluating and selecting the top 10 ideas out of 40. 
                        The "Monkey Poop War" concept, though unique, was considered too complex. The "Clicker Game" stood out for its simplicity and creative potential. 
                        Other ideas included bird-viewing, color combinations, and expression-changing applications.
                        <br><br>
                        The top contenders were "Monkey Poop War," "Clicker Game," "Bird Sounds," "Color Changing Game," and "Expression Changing." 
                        Sketches for the color mixing game showed creativity but faced limitations. 
                        The monkey poop game offered complexity but was ultimately set aside due to logistical challenges. 
                        The bird-viewing application needed further depth.
                        <br><br>
                        The process highlighted the need for an idea balancing uniqueness and feasibility. 
                        The clicker game emerged as a promising choice, with Thet's implementation adding innovative elements like a metronome and various game modes to improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes.
                        <br><br>
                        The resulting clicker game is designed to enhance hand-eye coordination and reflex responses in a fun and interactive manner. It offers diverse modes including 'Normal Mode' for classic clicking, 
                        'Color Mode' for visual stimulation, and 'Animal Mode' for both entertainment and education. With these options, players can tailor their experience, ensuring hours of entertainment and skill-building.

                <h3 class="colour">Ideation Ranking</h3>
                <p>We created a tier list of our top 40 ideas so that it is easy to rate them, our tier list ranged from (S) to (D), where (S) represents the top of the tier list and (D) represents the bottom-most tier. 
                    This made the sorting easier, making us consider only the top 10 ideas. Following are those top 10 ideas.

                                    It is good for the development of hand-eye coordination. This idea was eventually not chosen to go further because it seemed a bit too complicated and maybe not as unique.

                    were some of our top ideas to consider from. Other than these 10 ideas there were many influential and great ideas that could have been considered, but we unfortunately had to stop working on them due to the time constraints.

                    intimidating to approach. Overall it felt like there was a need for an idea that provided us a middle ground for uniqueness and approachability.

                                    different elements like animals, hazards, and colors can be introduced to not only make the game more creative but also help the users learn a lot of new things in the process.

                                <div class="car_desc">This implementation for the clicker game was created by Htet, Htet introduced ideas like the metronome, fish clicker, mole game, and mole buttons which made the game more interesting than it seemed at first glance. 
                                    This implementation helped us set the game apart from the rest of the top-chosen applications. It is also further shown how the clicker can be made smaller to make it more challenging, it addresses the theme of hand-eye coordination and making the participants better at their reflexes.
